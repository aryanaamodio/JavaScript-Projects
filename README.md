# Pizza Menu

This project is a menu used to order pizza with a various selection of toppings. It then takes the input information and calculates a price for the order.

# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

The classic game of tic-tac-toe but with Fairy's and Unicorns. Users can decide which token each player wants either a Fairy or a Unicorn in place of your classic X and O. The winner gets to hear a special magical song, but if it's a tie a Camel groans.

# Calculator

A basic 4 function calculator. Users can add, subtract, multiply, and divide on a sleek web version of a calculator.
